        <h1>Kevin Ochoa's Biography</h1>
        <p>
        My interests regarding are statistical analysis and creating informative data visuals 
        using programming languages! I am skilled in Python, Java, SQL. 
        I have also used MongoDB and React in my own personal projects.
        </p>

        <p>
        I come from a Hispanic household and reside in Queens, NY. 
        I enjoy trying new things (activities and foods), especially 
        in my own borough… Queens is enormous and very diverse!

        My favorite hobbies are playing intramural soccer, reading, and traveling. 
        I’ve played intramural soccer with a few of my closest friends for a past 
        three years here on campus. I enjoy reading articles and newsletters 
        tailored towards current trends (such as the ongoing AI boom). 
        I love visiting new cities and areas! Most recently, I’ve visited Boston 
        and Washington D.C. over the summer and had a great experience dining out and exploring 
        the different attractions/monuments with friends and family. 
        I’ve also studied abroad through the university’s Discovery Program where I spent 
        my first semester in Madrid, Spain!
